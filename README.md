# Dissertation: Filling the Missing Data in Electricity Supply Area Dataset Using Machine Learning Methods

This repository contains the code, methods, and findings from my Master of Data Science dissertation at City, University of London, titled: *"Filling the Missing Data in Electricity Supply Area Dataset Using Machine Learning Methods"*.

## ðŸ“– Abstract
This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of various imputation methods for addressing missing values in the secondary electricity supply area dataset. Seven methods were tested: Mean/Median/Mode, k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). This study found that MLP and RF outperformed simpler methods, significantly reducing error rates and capturing non-linear relationships in the data. However, none of the methods achieved perfect accuracy, particularly with high missing data percentages. The findings suggest that while advanced methods help improve results, there is still a need for better feature selection and more realistic simulation of missing data. Future studies should focus on selecting features that better capture important relationships and on simulating missing data patterns that mirror real-world situations. Overall, this research highlights the significance of selecting appropriate imputation methods for complex datasets and offers ways to improve prediction accuracy in the electricity supply area.
