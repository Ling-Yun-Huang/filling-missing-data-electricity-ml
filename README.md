# Dissertation: Filling the Missing Data in Electricity Supply Area Dataset Using Machine Learning Methods

This repository contains the code, methods, and findings from my Master's dissertation titled *"Filling the Missing Data in Electricity Supply Area Dataset Using Machine Learning Methods"*.

## Abstract
This research addresses the challenge of filling missing data in electricity supply area datasets using advanced machine learning methods, in collaboration with Advanced Infrastructure Technology Ltd. The dissertation involves the use of techniques such as Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptrons to impute missing values and explore feature selection for energy data management. The research focuses on methods that can aid in better energy forecasting and optimization, providing actionable insights for energy managers.
