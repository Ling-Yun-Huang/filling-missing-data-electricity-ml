## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

The following features were created from the various datasets:

### **1. Non-Domestic Electricity Consumption**  
For each MSOA, we calculate the **Non-Domestic Electricity Consumption per Building**:<br>
Non-Domestic Electricity Consumption (per Building) = (Total Non-Domestic Electricity Consumption (MSOA)) / (Commercial Building (MSOA))<br>

Then, for each ESA, we calculate the **Non-Domestic Electricity Consumption**:<br>
Non-Domestic Electricity Consumption (ESA) = Non-Domestic Electricity Consumption (per Building) √ó Commercial Building (ESA)

### **2. Domestic Electricity Consumption**  
Similar to non-domestic electricity consumption, we calculate the **Domestic Electricity Consumption per Building** using the LSOA dataset and the number of residential buildings. The result is then aggregated for each ESA.

### **3. Postcode Domestic Electricity Consumption**  
For each ESA, we sum the domestic electricity consumption from all postcodes within that ESA.

### **4. Population**  
We aggregate the population for each ESA based on the number of residential buildings. The **average population per residential building** is first calculated using the CV and OS datasets, then multiplied by the number of residential buildings in each ESA to determine the total population.

### **5. Building Number**  
We calculate the total number of buildings in each ESA using the OS dataset. This count includes all buildings within the ESA boundary, regardless of their type.

### **6. Building Density**  
Building density is calculated by dividing the total number of buildings in each ESA by the size of the area in square kilometres (km¬≤).
