### ‚öôÔ∏è Code Details

1. **Features & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Loads and inspects datasets.
   - Generates visualizations (e.g., distributions, correlations).
   - Performs feature engineering.

2. **Capacity Rating Imputation**
   - Applies machine learning models to estimate missing Capacity Rating values.
   - Models tested: Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), etc.
   - Compares model performance with a validation dataset.

3. **Peak Load Imputation**
   - Similar approach to Capacity Rating, but for Peak Load.
   - Feature selection based on correlation analysis.

4. **Impute to Actual Missing Values**
   - Uses trained models to fill in missing values in the dataset.
   - Validates imputed results against known patterns.
   - Proposes additional methods for simulating missing values.
